## Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomic Brain Mapping Across Species
![Schematic of single-nucleus and spatially-resolved transcriptomics in postmortem human brains. Totty et al. Unpublished.](transcriptomics.png)

This work aims to unravel the complex molecular landscapes of the human brain through cutting-edge transcriptomic approaches. This work involves creating detailed maps of the human postmortem brain with single-cell and spatial resolution, offering an unprecedented view of the cellular architecture that underlies human cognition and behavior. By conducting cross-species comparisons that span rodents, non-human primates, and humans, this research will bridge the gap between animal models and human biology. Looking ahead, this foundation will pave the way for future investigations into how these molecular landscapes change in psychiatric disease. These efforts are poised to reveal new insights into the biological underpinnings of mental health and disease, ultimately guiding the development of more effective therapies.

## Neural Circuits and Mechanisms of Fear Extinction
![Pavlovian conditioning, extinction, and renewal (A) are powerful behavior models for studying the neural mechanisms underlying fear relapse. Our previous work found that optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic Nucleus Reuniens (B) is sufficient to block fear relapse in rats (C). Totty et al. Nat Comm. (2023)](re_stim.png)

Fear extinction is an inhibitory learning process by which humans and rodents alike learn to suppress fear to previously threatening stimuli. My research investigates the neural circuits that mediate this fundamental process. Using sophisticated techniques such as _in vivo_ electrophysiology and optogenetics, my previous work discovered that the thalamic nucleus reuniens plays a critical role in synchronizing prefrontal and hippocampal theta oscillations, which ultimately acts to suppress fearful memories. This work is crucial for understanding the basic brain mechanism mediating fear suppression and has implications for treating anxiety disorders like PTSD.

## Behavioral Models Relevant for Psychiatric Disease

Uncovering how core mechanisms of fear extinction is impacted due to stress is essential for advancing our understanding of psychiatric diseases. To do this, we investigate the stress and stress-related neurotransmitters, such as norepinphrine, impact neural circuitry critical to fear regulation. By focusing on the amygdala and related brain regions, I aim to mimic the pathological conditions seen in human psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and generalized anxiety disorders. These models are critical for testing new therapeutic interventions and understanding the long-term effects of stress and other factors on mental health.
