Standard workflows necessitate several stages (quality control, normalization, differential expression), typically executed in R or Python, resulting in bottlenecks for non-experts. Existing platforms have alleviated certain challenges by offering graphical interfaces for data loading, normalization, differential gene expression analysis, and functional analysis; nevertheless, they typically do not incorporate integrated machine learning procedures for biomarker selection.\r\n\r\n**Method:** In this regard, we present omicML, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that combines transcriptomic data analysis with machine learning (ML)-based classification via integrating R and Python packages/libraries. It supports both RNA-Seq and microarray data, automating preprocessing (data import, quality control, and normalization) and differential expression analysis. The tool annotates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with descriptions, gene ontology, and pathway information and incorporates comparative analysis. Our extensive ML pipeline enables both supervised and unsupervised learning, integrates various datasets based on candidate gene signatures, standardizes and eliminates less significant features, benchmarks multiple ML classifiers with robust performance metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC), assesses feature importance, develops single-gene and multi-gene predictive models, and systematically finalizes the biomarker algorithm. All functionalities are available in omicML, hence reducing the barrier for biologists without computational proficiency.\r\n\r\n**Result:** In a case study, omicML identified a six-gene diagnostic model that distinguishes Mpox (monkeypox virus) infections from those caused by other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, and varicella-zoster. These results illustrate omicML's capacity to discern clinically relevant biomarkers from complex transcriptome data.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** Through the unified system, omicML (https://omicml.org), integrating data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, annotation, heatmap analysis, dataset integration, batch effect correction, machine learning approach, and functional analysis can diminish technical barriers and accelerates the conversion of expression data into diagnostic insights for clinicians and bench scientists.\r\n\r\n","tags":[],"title":"omicML: An Integrative Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Framework for Transcriptomic Biomarker Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joy Prokash Debnath","Tanvir Hossain","Papia Rahman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1760659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1762246812,"objectID":"777b3e68b690f5e408e295d06d78a597","permalink":"https://prokash21.github.io/publication/deep_profile/","publishdate":"2025-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deep_profile/","section":"publication","summary":"\n**Background:** Conventional differential gene expression (DGE) analysis inadequately captures the complex molecular changes that drive the progression of oropharyngeal carcinoma (OC). Variational Autoencoder (VAE) offers a deep learning approach to uncover hidden patterns in high-dimensional transcriptomic data, potentially revealing novel molecular regulators.\r\n\r\n**Methods:** Gene expression datasets were combined from multiple databases, and a VAE model was trained to compress the data into a low-dimensional latent space. Integrated Gradients, an automated attribution technique, was utilized to determine the contribution of each gene to each latent node (biological representation). Genes that consistently had high attribution scores across all latent dimensions were selected as potential regulators (driver genes). Pathway enrichment analysis and classification analyses unveiled the biological significance of these genes.\r\n\r\n**Results:** The VAE learned latent features that are biologically important, and Integrated Gradients revealed a group of genes that have a substantial impact on these features. RAP1GAP2 was consistently one of the top contributors across all 50 latent variables, which is noteworthy. RAP1GAP2 had the highest latent-space importance and strong discriminative power for distinguishing OC, with a performance of 0.769. This occurred despite the lack of substantial differential expression in tumors relative to normal samples. Biological interpretation suggests that RAP1GAP2, a protein that activates Rap1 GTPase, may facilitate tumor invasion by deactivating Rap1 and modulating MAPK signaling and Golgi-mediated secretion.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** Our deep learning framework identified RAP1GAP2 as a hidden driver in oropharyngeal carcinoma. This demonstrates how VAE and Integrated Gradients may discover molecular regulators overlooked by alternative approaches. This method delivers novel insights into the biology of OC tumors that could benefit future research and therapeutic approaches.\r\n\r\n","tags":[],"title":"Deep neural profiling reveals RAP1GAP2 as a latent regulator of tumor tnvasion in Oropharyngeal Carcinoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md.

The amplifying rate of infection has been reported across several regions of the Asian continent and has propagated in a multitude of people. The hidden factor that contributes to the detrimental circumstances of HNSCC in Bangladesh has not been revealed yet due to limited studies on HPV-associated HNSCC. HPV is one of the most critical factors accountable for developing HNSCC. This study aimed to identify the occurrence of HPV-associated HNSCC using multiplex PCR and Sanger sequencing techniques. Furthermore, we also identified HPV as the prime factor responsible for HNSCC through machine learning approaches.\r**Methods:** This cross-sectional study was performed on 214 histopathologically confirmed HNSCC-positive tissues for HPV molecular screening. The strain and its mutations in the L1 gene of HPV were identified from both multiplex PCR and Sanger sequencing data. Additionally, host protein expressions were observed in HPV-positive samples through immunohistochemistry. Finally, the best feature among all known factors that cause cancer was identified from the dataset using ML classification modules.\r**Results:** Of the 214 HNSCC-positive samples, 53 (24.8%) were HPV DNA positive, where a large number, 62.2% and 30.2%, of malignancies occurred in the buccal mucosa and tongue, respectively. In all these HPV-positive tissue samples, HPV16 was the main etiological agent, existing in 95% of cases. Along with HPV16, high-risk HPV18, 31, and 33 were also detected as causative factors of HNSCC in our study. Genomic exploration of HPV-positive cases (n=53) identified the presence of multiple HPV strains, showing \u003e95% sequence similarity compared to other HPV sequences with a BLAST search. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of host cellular markers p16INK4a, cyclin D1, and p53, confirming that HPV might be linked to the development of HNSCC. Linear Discriminant Analysis (the best-fitted model) with an AUC of 0.874 identified HPV infection as the best feature to classify cancer samples, which aligns with our hypothesis. In contrast, the other 181 of 214 (75.2%) HNSCC cases occurred due to non-infective agents, including betel quid, smoking, smokeless tobacco, and alcohol.\r**Conclusion:** HPV-associated HNSCC poses a significant threat, which is probably the unwitting cause of the enhanced occurrence rate. This insight might help pave the way to reduce the destructive nature of HNSCC and enlighten the clinical community of Bangladesh regarding HPV-associated HNSCC.\r","tags":[],"title":"Molecular screening of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients for Human Papillomavirus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabrina Bintay Sayed","Md Afser Rabbi","Joy Prokash Debnath","Kabir Hossen","Ajit Ghosh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1753315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1762246873,"objectID":"3e617e993e4c8fc740a35d99ba1918c1","permalink":"https://prokash21.github.io/publication/genome_wide/","publishdate":"2025-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/genome_wide/","section":"publication","summary":"\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent mRNA modifications in eukaryotes, playing a crucial role in plant development and stress responses. The m6A modification is regulated by three key components: writers (which add methyl groups), erasers (which remove them), and readers (which interpret the modification). Despite its significance, the role of m6A regulatory genes in plants, particularly in soybean, remains largely unexplored. This study identified 42 m6A regulatory genes in soybean through a comprehensive genome-wide analysis. Structural analysis revealed diverse gene architectures and functional variations across different subgroups. A total of 18 gene duplication events were identified, predominantly evolving under purifying selection. Network analysis and hub gene identification suggested weaker interactions among eraser proteins. Moreover, interaction analysis between miRNAs and soybean m6A regulatory genes indicated a stronger miRNA-mediated regulation of writer components compared to erasers and readers. Expression profiling under various stress conditions highlighted distinct regulatory patterns, where GmECT9, GmECT13, and GmECT17 were highly expressed in roots and nodules, while GmMTB2 and GmALKBH9B2 exhibited maximum upregulation and downregulation, respectively, under combined water deficit and heat stress. Additionally, in the case of mosaic virus infection, GmALKBH9B4 showed significant downregulation, whereas GmMTB1, GmMTB2, and GmALKBH9B1 were upregulated. This study provides a foundational framework for understanding m6A regulatory genes in soybean. The genome-wide insights presented here contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing m6A regulation and its potential implications for stress responses and plant development.\r\n\r\n","tags":[],"title":"Genome-wide identification and characterization of m6A regulatory genes in Soybean: Insights into evolution, miRNA interactions, and stress responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joy Prokash Debnath","Kabir Hossen","Sabrina Bintay Sayed","Md.

Recent studies have shown that Clade IIb (2022 MPXV) is marked by unique genomic mutations and epidemiological behaviors, suggesting variations in host-virus interactions. This study aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by the 2022 MPXV infection through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of microarray and RNA-Seq datasets from post-infected cell types with different MPXV clades. Subsequently, gene expression network analyses pinpoint the key DEGs, followed by their candidate drug assessment using the Drug SIGnatures DataBase (DSigDB) and validation by multiple machine learning algorithms. Comparative differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed 798 DEGs exclusive to the 2022 MPXV invasion in the skin cell types (keratinocytes). Intriguingly, 13 key DEGs were identified across hubs and clusters, highlighting their aberrant expressions in cell cycle regulation, immune responses, and cancer pathways. Biomarker screening via Random Forest (RF) model (selected with PyCaret from multiple models) and validation through t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, principal component analysis (PCA), and ROC curve analysis employing Logistic Regression and Random Forest, identified 6 key DEGs (TXNRD1, CCNB1, BUB1, CDC20, BUB1B, and CCNA2) as promising biomarkers (AUC \u003e 0.7) for clade IIb infection.

Of course, we need it. Instead, the question is: how attractive and elegant is the website? Being a Ph.D. student, it\u0026rsquo;s not a surprise that I find an academic-theme website very attractive. Developing such a website from the scratch needs huge time and effort. Luckily, there are open source templates such as Hugo templates. Recently I created my website using such a template. Below is a blurred screenshot of the site.\nWhat I like about the website are:\nIt is simple in design, attractive in appearance, and elegant in presentation. Easy to customize if you know R. HTML, JavaScript, or CSS knowledge is NOT necessary. The code is maintained as a repository in Github. As a result, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to edit or update the site. The site has been deployed in Github, no need to buy a domain name. It is also easy to deploy the site in a custom domain name. It offers a simple and powerful personal blogging feature. Seamlessly rendered in computers, cell-phones, iPads, and other devices. Though the Hugo academic template was fairly simple, first I had to figure out how to use it and then how to customize it. I started by looking into the blog posts by Alison Hill, Leslie Myint, and Ming Tang. While each of these blogs was helpful, the actual development was slightly different because things have changed since their publications. Here I share how I used and personalized the template.\nI divide the website development into four steps.\nRequirement gathering Just running a template site Personalizing the site Hosting and deployment Step-1: Requirement gathering I have R and RStudio installed on my computer. Working knowledge of R coding is necessary. Installed blogdown package in R. The book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown is a good resource to know the basics related to this website development. Installed GO language on the computer. I have a Github account. Working knowledge of Github is necessary. Step-2: Just running a template site I forked the starter-academic repository on my Github account. Alternatively, one can create a repository using starter-academic as a template.\nRenamed the repository to alorchhota.github.io from Settings. Please note the name format here: [myaccountid].github.io. This name format would be useful later to deploy the website. Here is my repository \u0026ndash; you may take a look if you like.\nCloned the repository on my local computer using Terminal.\ngit clone https://github.com/alorchhota/alorchhota.github.io # remember to use your repository\rOpened the repository in RStudio as a new package (from an existing directory). There I loaded the blogdown package and installed Hugo.\nlibrary(blogdown)\rblogdown::install_hugo()\rRestarted RStudio \u0026ndash; required for loading the updated $PATH variable.\nIn Rstudio, I built the template website, and start the server.\nlibrary(blogdown)\rbuild_site()\r# hugo: downloading modules â€¦\r# hugo: collected modules in 15019 ms\r# Start building sites â€¦ # # | EN # -------------------+-----\r# Pages | 52 # Paginator pages | 0 # Non-page files | 7 # Static files | 3 # Processed images | 39 # Aliases | 12 # Sitemaps | 1 # Cleaned | 0 # # Total in 26388 ms\rserve_site()\r# Launching the server via the command:\r# C:/Users/Shatil/AppData/Roaming/Hugo/0.80.0/hugo.exe server --bind 127.0.0.1 -p 4321 --themesDir themes -D -F --navigateToChanged\r# Serving the directory . at http://localhost:4321\r# Launched the hugo server in the background (process ID: 9296). To stop it, call blogdown::stop_server() or restart the R session.\rAt this point, the template website was visible in the RStudio Viewer panel (see the image below). When I clicked on the button as marked by a red circle, the website opened in a web browser. Generally, the website updated updated each time I saved any change. Occasionally, I needed to stop the site by calling stop_server(), and then restart by calling build_site() and serve_site() manually.\nStep-3: Personalizing the site The variables in the template repository are pretty self-explanatory and need no explanation.

Most network analyses to date have been limited to assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a single tissue or small sets of tissues. Here, we built networks that additionally capture the regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, along with tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10 groups of related tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with pairs of adjacent nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing. Our networks provide an improved understanding of the complex relationships of the human transcriptome across tissues. # # Summary.

The knowledgebase of pathways contains the interactions among the genes. However, it is not necessary for all the genes in a pathway to interact with each other. Closely interacting genes are supposed to have a collective effect to cause cancer or other disease. Here we propose a novel cancer classification method utilizing the collective effect of the set of closely interacting genes which we call Gene Interaction Set (GIS). We first find out the possible strength levels of each gene interaction set using clustering method and then rank all the sets with our proposed entropy metric using the proportion of samples of different classes having same strength level and finally predict the class of a new sample by weighted voting of top k gene interaction sets. The important feature of our method is that the process of causing the disease can easily be figured out. We validate our method comparing with other classification methods known to produce very high accuracy on 7 cancer datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Gene Interaction-Level Cancer Classification using Gene Expression Profiles","type":"talk"}]
