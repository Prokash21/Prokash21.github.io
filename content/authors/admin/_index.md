I am a graduate research assistant at the department of BMB, SUST, working under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UsY6uSEAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Tanvir Hossain</a> , who did his PhD at AIBN, UQ, where I worked as a research intern with glycoRNA. Besides that, I work on a collaborative project on cancer genomics with BMU, Dhaka, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UsY6uSEAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. S. M.Rashed Ul Islam</a>.

Having come from a mathematical family, I have always approached biochemistry from a translational perspective, connecting biology with computational techniques to solve biological problems. Initially, I learned various sites of computational biology such as scRNA-seq, ML, and neuroscience, from <a href="https://preonath.github.io/about.html">Preonath Chondrow Dev</a> , work as a research officer in CHRF, Dhaka. In one of my current research projects, I am investigating some <a href="https://github.com/Prokash21/Deep-Neural-Profiling">latent features</a>, which are the molecular driver genes, controlling the regulation of a molecular pathway, using the VAE + IG framework of neural networks. Through mental simulation, one can understand by observing the functionality of a conductor—a latent regulator, who moves the baton to control the tempo of the orchestra. I leverage various wet lab techniques, for example RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, to validate my findings.

I firmly believe that maintaining a peaceful mind is essential for both living life fully and conducting research effectively. Sri Krishna says, “The mind can be your greatest ally or your worst enemy.” Nowadays, I have a strong desire to uncover the mysteries of our brain.

<!--# Earlier, I completed my undergraduate degree, when I got involved in projects with my two respected faculty members: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VESJwAMAAAAJ&hl=en">Ajit Ghosh, PhD</a>, who runs the Genomics and Transcriptomics laboratory, and <a href="https://www.sust.edu/departments/bmb/faculty/papia-bmb@sust.edu">Papia Rahman</a>, who runs a collaborative work in nanoparticles with the department of Chemistry, BUET -->
