## About This Tutorial

Four different types of nitrogenous bases are found in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, the thymine is replaced by uracil (U). 

This educational resource provides a comprehensive overview of nitrogenous base structures, covering both purines (adenine, guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil). Understanding these fundamental building blocks of DNA and RNA is crucial for students studying biochemistry and molecular biology.

## Key Topics Covered

The tutorial explains the structural differences between purines and pyrimidines, their chemical properties, and their roles in nucleic acid formation. Ideal for medical students, university students, and intermediate-level learners seeking to master this foundational biochemistry concept.
