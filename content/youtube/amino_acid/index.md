## About This Video Tutorial

This video tutorial presents a shortcut method to learn all 20 amino acids in just 10 minutes. Many students struggle with memorizing the 20 different amino acid names and their chemical structures, so this project aims to simplify the learning process through visual demonstration and mnemonic techniques.

## Key Features

This resource is designed to help medical students, university students, and intermediate-level learners quickly understand and retain amino acid structures without the usual memorization burden.

## Note

This tutorial includes visual explanations of amino acid structures. While efforts were made for accuracy, there are some minor technical notes regarding structural representations (such as tryptophan's carbon bonds, arginine's NH2+ bonding, and glycine's alpha bond configurations).
