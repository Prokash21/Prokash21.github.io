### KIN School
<center><img src="media/Kin_School.jpg"></center>

[KIN School](https://kinsust.org/kin-school) is a magical place, full of little magicians. And why do I call them that? <br>
All of life’s worries simply just fade away just by being around them. Especially on Fridays, when I used to enter the shahjalal university schoolyard with my guitar in the afternoon, many of them would run toward me shouting, “Joy Vaiya! Joy Vaiya!” Their innocence and love made me forget all my academic pressures and struggles of life.<br>
I really miss them nowadays. I’ve been busy with my career and research and rarely get the chance to strum my guitar with their voices around me…<br>
The pictures above capture some beautiful moments with them!


###  KIN (A Voluntary Organization)
<center><img src="media/Kin.jpg" /></center>

I was a scout during my school life, and there was a motto I promised to follow, which is to help at least one person every day, in any way I can. In university, [KIN](https://kinsust.org) gave me the opportunity to continue doing something meaningful for people in need.<br>
I have donated blood multiple times, and the most priceless thing is that some of the people I helped still call me to ask about my health. (First picture on the left.)<br>
In the second picture, I was distributing blankets. In the second row, second column, we were sorting the collected winter clothes. In the next picture, I was selling books at the charity book fair, and in the last one, the poster you see was designed by me to invite students from other universities to our charity film festival.

###  Teaching & Mentoring 

Growing up watching my father serve as a schoolteacher for three decades shaped my instinct to teach and guide others. The first real opportunity came during the COVID-19 lockdown, when I organized an online science batch for students who had just completed SSC. I even built a handmade stand to hold my phone during classes. With the earnings from my first month, I gifted a watch to Shahrul Vai, my physics and chemistry mentor whose notes I used in my lectures, cleared a hostel due, and supported my family at home.

From that starting point, I led two batches of HSC students, teaching physics, biology, and chemistry. Later, I taught SSC-level physics and biology at a coaching center in Sylhet, followed by two full university-admission batches where many students secured places in major public universities. Altogether, through online classes, coaching centers, and private tutoring, I taught and mentored more than 80 students.


### Travelling and Photography

I’ve always loved exploring new places. The best part of going on a summit is losing your mobile network for those five or six days and it feels like the outside world doesn’t exist.<br>
I love taking photos and feel passionate about capturing the harmony of nature. Looking back at those pictures in my archive is like pressing Ctrl + Z, which instantly takes me back to that exact moment.<br>
Here are some moments I captured during my travels.

### Music

Everyone in my family is involved in music. Though I was initially pressured to learn, I eventually fell in love with it.<br> In 2013, I secured first place in classical music at the [Zila Shilpakala Academy](https://shilpakala.narsingdi.gov.bd/), Narsingdi, and overall won prizes in both school and national competitions, including Best Singer in Classical Music at Mohammadpur Thana ([College](https://sjs.edu.bd/new/index.php) time).<br>
As my fascination with different musical instruments grows, I've already learned to play more than 12 (you can find some of them pictured above), and I aspire to play every instrument that exists in the world.
Here are a few moments from my performances in different programs at SUST.

### Sports

Since childhood, I’ve loved playing sports, especially football. I started watching football because of Kaká, and I’ve been a ultra Real Madrid fan. I played as a midfielder for the BMB team in the SUST Inter-Department Football Tournament 2023.<br>
The picture on the left is from a match during BMB Sports Week 2022, and the one on the right was taken when we became runners-up in the BMB Champions League 2022.

### Reading Books

Honestly, I’m not an avid reader, but I truly enjoy reading. This habit grew in me from my research teammates, especially Kabir.<br>
Here are some of the books I’ve really liked and found inspiring.
